# Substack2Markdown

Substack2Markdown is a Python tool for downloading free and premium Substack posts and saving them as both Markdown and 
HTML files, and includes a simple HTML interface to browse and sort through the posts. It will save paid for content as 
long as you're subscribed to that substack. 

🆕 @Firevvork has built a web version of this tool at [Substack Reader](https://www.substacktools.com/reader) - no 
installation required! (Works for free Substacks only.)

Once you run the script, it will create a folder named after the substack in `/substack_md_files`,
and then begin to scrape the substack URL, converting the blog posts into markdown files. Once all the posts have been
saved, it will generate an HTML file in `/substack_html_pages` directory that allows you to browse the posts.

You can either hardcode the substack URL and the number of posts you'd like to save into the top of the file, or 
specify them as command line arguments.

## Features
